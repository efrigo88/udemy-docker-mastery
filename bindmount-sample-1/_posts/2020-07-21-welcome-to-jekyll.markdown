Welcome to my new Jekyll-powered blog! I'm excited to share my journey in web development and technology with you. This platform will serve as a space for sharing knowledge, experiences, and insights about the ever-evolving world of software development.

## Why Jekyll?

Jekyll is a fantastic static site generator that transforms your plain text into static websites and blogs. It's perfect for developers because:

- It's simple yet powerful
- No database required
- Built-in support for Markdown
- GitHub Pages integration
- Fast performance
- Great for version control

## Getting Started

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

## Code Examples

Jekyll offers powerful support for code snippets. Here's a simple example in Python:

{% highlight python %}
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Let's print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
for i in range(10):
    print(f"Fibonacci({i}) = {fibonacci(i)}")
{% endhighlight %}

And here's a JavaScript example:

{% highlight javascript %}
// A simple async function example
async function fetchData(url) {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(url);
        const data = await response.json();
        return data;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    }
}

// Usage
fetchData('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(data => console.log(data));
{% endhighlight %}
